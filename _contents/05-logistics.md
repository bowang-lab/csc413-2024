**Grading:** 
* Homework, 50 points: There will be 4 homework assignments. Homework will consist of some combination of math and coding. Each homework is worth 12.5 points.
* Midterm, 20 points: The midterm will take place on 10/17 and will cover all topics discussed before the midterm.
* Final Project, 30 points: For the course project, you will implement a research idea related to the course material. Details will be released later.

**Late work, collaboration rules, and the honor code:** 

Every student has a total of 7 grace days to extend the coursework deadlines through the semester. Each grace day allows for a 24 hours deadline extension without late penalty. That is, you may apply the grace days on a late submission to remove its late penalty. The maximum extension you may request is up to the remaining grace days you have banked up. We will keep track of the grace days on MarkUs. After the grace period, assignments will be accepted up to 3 days late, but 10% will be deducted for each day late, rounded up to the nearest day. After that, submissions will not be accepted and will receive a score of 0.

You are welcome to work together with other students on the homework. You are also welcome to use any resources you find (online tutorials, textbooks, papers, chatbots, etc.) to help you complete the homework. However, you must list any collaboration or resources you used to complete each homework on each assignment. If you hand in homework that involved collaboration and/or makes use of content that you did not create and you do not disclose this, you will get a 0 for that homework. In addition, it is likely that you will be able to use some resource (be it another student, ChatGPT, or whatever) that can help you solve many of the homework problems. However, note that if you rely too much on such resources you will likely not learn the material and will do poorly on the exams, during which such resources will not be available.
